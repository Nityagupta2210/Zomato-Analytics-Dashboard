# Unlocking the Flavors of Bangalore: A Zomato Dataset Analysis
 

**Description:**
 

I was always fascinated by the food culture of Bengaluru. Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bangalore. From the United States to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all types of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, Bars, Drinks, Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bangalore has it. Bangalore is best place for foodies. The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bangalore, and the aggregate rating of each restaurant. Currently, it stands at approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such a high number of restaurants. This industry hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However, it has become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. Most of them serve the same food. Bangalore is an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants, it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. Most importantly it will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost, etc for a particular location. It also aims at finding similarity between neighborhoods of Bangalore on the basis of food. The dataset also contains reviews for each of the restaurants which will help in finding the overall rating for the place.
